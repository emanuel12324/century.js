century.js
=======

A purely JavaScript, super light-weight, ultra fast and easy to use plugin that eliminates the problem of centering elements in web pages. Century can center veritcally (the most challenging problem faced by this plugin) and can center horizontally.

=======

There is only one function in the plugin. The usage is as follows:
#####century(parent, element);

parent - what you would like to count as its parent element. Usually we suggest its parent element.

element - the element that you would like to be centered
